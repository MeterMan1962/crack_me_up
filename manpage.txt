                                    OPTIONS
                
python3 ./Ptool.py [options]

       --c       :   Checks inputed password, returns a letter grade and suggestions to
                     improve password.

       --g       :   Generates brand new password, length always 10-16 characters, 
                     variety of lowercase letters, capital letters, numbers, and 
                     allowed special characters.

       --gc      :   Performs same function as [--g] option, yet returns a letter
                     grade and provides suggestions to improve generated password. 

       --cp      :   Compares <inputedpassword> against a large list of compromised
                     passwords, returns status if the <inputedpassword> is leaked.

       --ch      :   Use this option if you need to crack md5, sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384, and sha512 hashed
                     passwords. After typing --ch, simply input the hashed password. By default, this option 
                     will use the rockyou.txt wordlist to crack your inputed hash.
                     URGENT: If you wish to use this, you need to make a clean copy of rockyou.txt,
                     as it has characters that cannot be encoded. Please paste this command-
                     iconv -f utf-8 -t utf-8 -c /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt > ~/rockyou_clean.txt.  

       --tc      :   Gives a time estimate on how long it would take to crack the inputed password.

       --hp      :   Hashes inputed password into sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384, sha512.

       --sc      :   Brute forces ssh password using given password list. Requires ssh username, ip of target,
                     and wordlist.
